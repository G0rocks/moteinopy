Moteinopy
=========

Direct communication from python to node
----------------------------------------

This module was written to handle communication on a moteino network. [Moteinos] are great little arduino clones that have an onboard RFM69 which gives them wireless capabilities. This makes them great for home automation or similar situation.

This module assumes a setup of the form:

BaseMoteino should be programmed with the BaseSketch that can be found on the [GitHub] site. 

I recommend reading through the examples scripts on GitHub to see how to use the module
